# Key Technical Decisions

## Hardware Decisions

1. **Arduino Board Selection**: TBD
   - Considerations: I/O requirements, memory needs, processing power

2. **ILI9341 Display Implementation**: Using standard SPI interface
   - Rationale: Provides good performance with minimal pin usage
   - Alternative considered: Parallel interface (requires more pin count requirements)

3. **Power Supply**: TBD
   - Requirements will depend on final hardware configuration

## Software Decisions

1. **Library Selection**: Adafruit GFX and ILI9341 libraries
   - Rationale: Well-maintained, good documentation, active community support
   - Alternative considered: Custom display driver (rejected due to development time)

2. **Code Organization**: Modular approach with separate components
   - Benefits: Easier maintenance, better testability, clearer structure

3. **Memory Management**: Careful consideration of SRAM usage
   - Strategy: Minimize global variables, use PROGMEM for constants where appropriate
